Shakti is an advanced virtual voice assistant designed to interact with users through natural language processing and speech recognition. Unlike mainstream voice assistants like Google Assistant, Alexa, and Siri, Shakti is built to be highly customizable, open-source, and focused on user privacy and control. This first version of Shakti lays the foundation for a versatile assistant that can perform a wide range of tasks, from answering questions to opening specific applications, and more.
